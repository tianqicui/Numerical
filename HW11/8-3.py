# Input value of constants in equations

# Definition of Lorenz equations

# Input range and interval of time

# Make arrays to store the results

# Input initial conditions

# Use Rungeâ€“Kutta method to solve equations
for t in tpoints:

# Make the plot of y as function of t

# From figure 1 we notice that it is quite hard to tract the trajectory of y. 

#b)
# Make the plot of z as function of x
figure(2)
plot(zpoints,xpoints)

# From figure 2 we notice that the trajectory of z and x has the similar shape of butterfly if we ingore the initial part.
